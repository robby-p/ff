        <p>
          Hello, I'm Robby Polana &lt;@rpolana&gt; - working @ sqsp doing
          front-end development on #member-accounts past ~2 years
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We use webpack to compile our modules into bundles and modern es6
          javascript, jsx to es5 among a quite few other thing
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          One of other things we use webpack for; is delivering individually
          bundled assets for 5 other unique locales, (portuguese italian german
          french and spanish)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bundling locales is accomplished by essentially running webpack for
          <em>every single locale</em> (more specifically exporting an array
          from the webpack config)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Running webpack for every locale is great because the implementation
          is simple. For everyone locale you are creating an exclusive distinct
          bundle by trimming out 'chunks' (pieces of a webpack bundle) which are
          not apart of that locale. For instance your italian bundle should not
          include french or german chunks etc -- This mechanism is called the
          ContextReplacementPlugin; more on that later;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          How do these chunks get included in the first place? What is italian
          specific locale data doing with german or french translations and
          formatting?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      background on require(...) - commonjs module syntax
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Modern javascript uses modules to manage dependencies, gone are the
          days of relying on the ordering of script tags to properly load your
          dependencies.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Modules give us encapsulation, reusability, distinct declarations of
          dependencies on other modules, and proper ordering of instantiation
          and execution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          One of the most common module syntax today is <code>require</code> -
          or the commonjs module specification. This syntax is widely used today
          particularly on Nodejs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          (a new syntax exist which will likely supplant <code>require</code>,
          import or es6 module syntax;)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In <code>require</code> commonjs modules are loaded synchronously.
          Modules <em>may also</em> be resolved dynamically or in other words
          resolved at runtime - for example,
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js"><div><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> loader = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">loader</span>(<span class="hljs-params">language</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;../../../packs/&quot;</span> + language + <span class="hljs-string">&quot;.json&quot;</span>);
</div></code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In server side NodeJS (the most common commonjs implementation), this
          is not an issue since you can synchronously read from the file system
          without much or virtually any latency.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          (If behind the scenes this went the asynchronous route you would have
          to use a callback or promise, thus affecting the calling code)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          for the frontend client side browser, whose resource access is limited
          to transferal over network layer; which has a good deal of latency,
          rather than a file system. There is a little trick webpack uses to
          accomplish both a synchronous module <code>require</code>
          <em>and dynamic resolution</em>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Include the whole file system in the bundle! (Kind of but not really.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In the above example, webpack will see you're dynamically resolving a
          file in the <code>/packs</code> directory, therefore it will
          <em>include all of packs</em>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          This example was taken directly from <code>@sqs/18n-ui</code>, which
          &quot;provides i18n utilities for formatting, translating and
          displaying user interfaces.&quot; uses this dynamic synchronous
          loading and looks like this
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          By default webpack would include everything in
          <code>@sqs/i18n-ui</code> packages
          <code>../../../packs/</code> directory, this would result in a
          needlessly larger total bundle size, there is no need to include an
          Italian language pack when the consumer's locale is set to German
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong
        >This is unless we utilized the previously mentioned
        ContextReplacementPlugin</strong
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Since we run wepback for each locale, thus generated a bundle
          exclusively and individually, we can tell Webpack to only include the
          <em>Italian</em> locale file or files in
          <code>../../../packs/</code> for the <em>Italian</em> bundle, same for
          german spanish french and portuguese.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Our webpack plugin configuration therefore looks like this:</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-js"><div>    plugins: [
      <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> webpack.ContextReplacementPlugin(<span class="hljs-regexp">/@sqs\/i18n-ui\/packs$/</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">RegExp</span>(<span class="hljs-string">`(<span class="hljs-subst">${locale}</span>).json$`</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;ig&#x27;</span>)),
      ...
    ]

</div></code></pre>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          These differentiated 'trimmed' bundles are then served discriminately
          on inbound requests for our <code>index.html</code> file.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          So as a user and setting your locale to Italian, we would serve the
          <code>index.html</code> with something like this,
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-html"><div>  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">html</span> <span class="hljs-attr">lang</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;it&quot;</span>&gt;</span>
  ...
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span> <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;MyApp-it.js&quot;</span> &gt;</span>
</div></code></pre>
    <ul>
      <li>for german:</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-html"><div>  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">html</span> <span class="hljs-attr">lang</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;de&quot;</span>&gt;</span>
  ...
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span> <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;MyApp-de.js&quot;</span> &gt;</span>

    <p>etc.</p>

        <p>
          This solution is common and simple in execution, but doesn't scale
          well
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We are shipping a complete set of bundles
          <em>for every single locale</em> rather than just our source and our
          locale specific code
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>As the amount of locales increases so will the amount of bundles</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          On top of just the ContextReplacementPlugin happening in our webpack
          build, there are countless other processes and compilations which take
          place.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The resulting production assets are huge, which have lead to uploading
          timeouts when moving assets to our asset store in the ci pipeline
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          This method is problematic in that it has very long build times,
          upload times, timeouts and out of memory errors.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Most importantly production builds locally; (sometimes needed for
          debugging), are either impractically long or nearly impossible as out
          of memory errors are common
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="solution">solution</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          We want to be able to provide unique exclusive locales to our users
          without unnecessarily compiling and shipping duplicating code.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          This can be accomplished by looking further into webpack's require
          mechanisms
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <code>require.context</code>, <code>require.resolveWeak</code>, and
          the not official somewhat of a hack; <code>__webpack_require__</code>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <code>require.context</code> traditionally gives you a different set
          of control on how you do your <em>dynamic</em> imports, you pass it a
          directory, and then you regex for the files within that directory you
          want to designate as chunks. <code>require.context</code>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The part we're interested in, in <code>require.context</code> is
              that module-designation ability. The third argument, the mode,
              sync, or eager. The module type will be 'lazy' as this makes it a
              lazy loadable chunk, The intention of this functionality is to
              create asynchronous chunks. But we are interested in at as it will
              create an individual chunk not included in the current file.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The resulting call looks like this</p>
            <pre><code class="language-js"><div>  <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>.context(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;./sqs-i18n-translations/strings&quot;</span>,<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,<span class="hljs-regexp">/.*\.yaml/</span>,<span class="hljs-string">&#x27;lazy&#x27;</span>);
</div></code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Lazy chunk splitting is not limited to code in #member-accounts.
              We also need to do it in our Squarespace libraries. To accomplish
              lazy chunk splitting for internal libraries, a patch using
              <code>patch-package</code> library was implemented. The
              <code>require.context</code> above was then included in these
              libraries. The <code>require.context</code> looking nearly
              identical to the one here.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <code>__webpack_require__</code> - Is internally what your
          <code>require</code>s get compiled into, this is syntax is used to
          require something without webpack analyzing it and including a
          dependency into a bundle.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <code>require.resolveWeak</code> - This mechanism will
          <em>resolve</em> your module, or <em>lookup</em> the 'path' of a given
          module, without pulling it into the bundle.
          <code>require.resolveWeak</code> is side-effectless lookup. It only
          returns the module path, and does nothing else. This is used to come
          up with a path to pass into <code>__webpack_require__</code>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Here is an example patch being used in
          <code>@sqs/i18n-components</code>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-diff"><div>function translationsLoader(translationLocale) {
<span class="hljs-deletion">-  return require(&quot;../../sqs-i18n-translations/strings/&quot;.concat(PACKAGE_NAME, &quot;.&quot;).concat(translationLocale, &quot;.yaml&quot;));</span>

<span class="hljs-addition">+  require.context(&quot;../../sqs-i18n-translations/strings&quot;,true,/.*\.yaml/,&#x27;lazy&#x27;);</span>

<span class="hljs-addition">+  return __webpack_require__(require.resolveWeak(&quot;../../sqs-i18n-translations/strings/&quot;.concat(PACKAGE_NAME, &quot;.&quot;).concat(translationLocale, &quot;.yaml&quot;)));</span>
  }

</div></code></pre>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          There is a lazy chunk designation, and a traditional dynamic
          <code>require</code> is being swapped out with
          <code>__webpack_require__(require.resolveWeak(...)</code>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The fourth piece of the puzzle is gathering all these individual
          chunks by locale discriminately so it can be served to our user later
          on in one piece, so all of our libraries and code will have these
          chunks ready by the time they load.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <code>require.context</code> Separates our locale data into individual
          chunks. Our locale data is split into individual chunks, but we need a
          way to group them all by their locale as they exist across multiple
          libraries. So the source for a given locale across multiple libraries
          can be loaded on demand. This is easy to do in a webpack config with
          its 'splitChunks' mechanism in <code>webpack.config.js</code>
          <code
            >js splitChunks: { cacheGroups: { i18n: { priority: 10, test:
            /sqs-i18n-translations.strings|@sqs.i18n-ui.packs|moment.locale/,
            chunks: 'all', name(module, chunks, cacheGroupKey) { const locale =
            getModuleLocaleFromName(module); return `i18n-${locale}`; }, },
          </code>
          From the module name, which is usually of the form
          <code>it.js</code> or <code>pt.js</code> or <code>de.js</code> it's
          pretty easy to figure out which locale they are, so for this example
          we use a made up function <code>getModuleLocaleFromName</code> to do
          that. (the actual implementation is a bit more involved but this is
          for the sake of the example). These individual files were made
          available as individual chunks by <code>require.context</code>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Our result then is a <em>catch all</em> chunk, 1 chunk for each
              locale, across multiple libraries.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The resulting locale file will look like:
              <code>i18n-it.js</code> or <code>i18n-pt.js</code> or
              <code>i18n-de.js</code>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since splitting the chunks, has already been taken care of by
              <code>require.context</code> which then got catch all'd into a
              locale file, it is up to us to include it ourselves.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The 5th final piece of this long winding journey to a better
              locale story is serving our locale file to the user.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The user makes an inbound request to <code>index.html</code>,
              their locale preference is determined on the backend and we insert
              the locale bundle request as a script tag, first and foremost,
              ordering is important, as the chunks need to be available to
              webpack.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The result is something like this (for german, <code>de</code>)</p>
